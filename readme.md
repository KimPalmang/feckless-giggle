# Testing out Angular 2
Basic app with basic routing, will probably improve over time with more documentation and more comments in the code.
Now im just happy it works! :)

## Setup
1. Clone, download or something with the repo (get the code)
2. Run npm install (install dependencies)
3. Run gulp build (builds the environment in a folder called build)
4. Run gulp dev (Loads the app in the browser)

Note: if you run gulp clean the build catalog resets to empty, clean, build, dev repeat! :)
